This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Background 


Project was made in collaboration with a friend, who handled a lot of the design, while I handled all the coding. The premise of it was to create a game that would help people pass time during quarantine, and, for me personally, to do more work in React while also incorporating React Router into a project. 


## Final Product 

The final product is visible at https://sherlocked.xyz and is hosted through Azure.
